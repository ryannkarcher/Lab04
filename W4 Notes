concatenation: process of combining two or more strings
   together to create a new strings

OPEN CLASS NOTES
   - comparison operator = used to compare two values <>=
   - concatenate = process of joining two+ strings together to make new string
   - equality operator = used to compare two values for equality
      - == used to check loose equality: equal in value but not type
      - === used for strict equality: equal in value and type
   - math operations = math +-/*% (modulo is the last one, subtract
      numbers over and over again)
   - null = represents intentional absence of object value
   - number = number; integers and floating-point numbers
   - string = characters/words 
   - type coercion = automatic or implicit conversion of a value
   - undefined = type represents variable that has been declared
      but not assigned a value
   - variable = container that holds value; var
   - console.log() = view otuput messages in console window
   - NaN = what you get when you put undefined var with defined var
   - BigInt = numeric value that can represent numbers larger than 
      max safe integer of (2^53)-1, with suffic n at the end
   - symbol = primitive data that represents unique identifier

   declaring VARIABLES
      - var or let 

   - dynamic typing= data type implicitly based on data assigned
   - loosely typed (weakly typed) = dat atype of variable can change

   REASSIGN VARIABLES
      - var myVar = 5;
      - myVar =8; DO NOT REPEAT VAR (INTRODUCTORY)


QUESTIONS:
   - does the first boolean expression always need to be false?
